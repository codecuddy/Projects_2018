# Projects_2018

This site is a way for me to essentially keep a log of my daily activities centered around programming. 


I wanted to have ways to track my progress, learning, and mini coding challenges/goals, 
in order to stay sharp on previously learned material, while learning new languages and frameworks.


I will also use this site to track books and articles I'm reading, or have read. As well as giving me a place
to keep all of my ideas for apps, document job applications, and resources to further my learning.
