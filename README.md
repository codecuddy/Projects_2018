# Projects_2018

I want to have on main project that I am working on everyday... this is currently iOS 11. 

However, I also wanted to have ways to track my progress, learning, and mini coding challenges/goals, 
in order to stay sharp on previously learned material. 

Right now the site is just HTML, but small projects through out the year will transform the site.
